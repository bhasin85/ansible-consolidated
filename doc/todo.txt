to buy
  - apu power supply. without adaptor
  - 1/2m and 1m patch cable
  - rubber feet
  - label stickers

----

- can't just route to aws, because gateway has to be isp. must be tunnel.

- create a bridge, but connected to eth0 on laptop and see if it will broadcast, and
  we can make a container interact with router dhc
- what is hairpining?
- fixup the network interface restarts in ansible
- understand svi..
- cisco2 use fa0/1 for trunk instead of fa0/4
- combine vlan 200 and 201, and separate out voice

- dns isn't working on switches - eg. when try to ping www.google.com or use ntp.

- get a container/vm doing vlan tagging and interacting with trunks.
- setup git server / container.
- get ntp running again / dns - because it's good to get logs

-----

done - integrate second switch
  - advantages of using 1g switch.
    - view of mac table, packets
    - router on stick config
    - remove a wire
    - get to try router <-> trunk <-> trunk config
    - put voip on separate vlan
    - free the unmanaged cisco for use with the htpc
    - ergonomic, lower, not on table.

  - done - create two trunk ports for 100,120,200. then plug the router in, and wan in.

  - done provision /
  - done restart router, ,

done - show the L2 macs at the end of the ports? show mac address-table
done - remove the two ethernet connections to bravia and nuc, and use unmanaged switch.
    - replace the longer ethernet connector with a shorter one
    - can tidy the power away too.
done - test with netgear,
done - swap 42 and 43 if we ever swap to vlan there won't be an issue?
done - ok, we just need to get the config backed up
done - move the management interface to another vlan. or move the brother to something else.
done - backup cisco100 config
done - check laptop comes up?.
done - Try router reboot. and check if the vlans come up.
done - set up ssh and management interface - so can easily connect, when won't have cable
