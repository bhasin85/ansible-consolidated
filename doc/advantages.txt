Developer oriented, composible container-based stack.

- Fast. container boot time, 2 to 10 seconds, reduced ram/cpu system resources

- Useful shell-tools installed - vim, screen, mlocate

- Flexible bridged subnet with NAT, local dns and dhcp services

- Composible, mix and match containers, with VBox VMs, with production instances as needed

- Subnet separation allows production GS,GN, Portal to continue to be accessible from host

- Authoritative DNS zone server - can simulate entire production network topology. eg. CNAME redirect

- For container instances - complex configuration not necessary for development removed. eg,
  - reverse-proxy,
  - squid caching,
  - ssl termination,
  - firewall,
  - nagios, backup system roles, db roles etc

- Apps are configured with a debug configuration
  - debug ports enabled in tomcat7
  - postgres listens on 0.0.0.0,
  - debug logging turned on,
  - admin,admin pass for geoserver etc.

- Pre-configured test data (only for gn records, vocab, picker)

- Fast provisioning with Ansible

- easy access to container system filesystems without booting node

- snapshots when combined with ZFS - equivalent to Docker unionfs


Limitations,
  - WIP
  - Developer focused
  - Linux host needed
  - Configuration less localized
  - Must understand DNS, DHCP services
